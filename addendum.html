        <p>This text-based adventure game was created as part of an assignment. The development process involved defining the game's narrative structure, choices, and outcomes in the JavaScript object <code>gameData</code>.</p>
        <p>Each game stage is associated with specific text, choices, and images. The <code>updatePage</code> function dynamically updates the HTML content based on the current game stage.</p>
        <p>Styling was achieved using CSS to create a clean and visually appealing interface. The game is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>The development process included overcoming challenges such as ensuring proper event handling for user choices, managing dynamic content updates, and optimizing images for a better user experience.</p>
